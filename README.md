# FullAdder
In this project, I have designed and implemented a 1-bit Full Adder using CMOS technology in the Cadence Virtuoso environment with the GPDK 90nm process node. The design began at the transistor level by first implementing a NAND gate using CMOS logic, and then using these NAND gates to construct the complete Full Adder circuit with A, B, and Cin as inputs and Sum and Cout as outputs. The adder performs binary addition of three input bits and outputs the resulting sum and carry using standard CMOS logic gates. The circuit's functional correctness was verified using Spectre simulations and waveform analysis in Virtuoso. This project demonstrates core concepts in digital CMOS design, logic gate construction, and transistor-level schematic implementation using industry-grade EDA tools, highlighting key aspects of VLSI design such as compact layout, low power consumption, and scalability.
